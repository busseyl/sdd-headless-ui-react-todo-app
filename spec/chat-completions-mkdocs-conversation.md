busseyl: Now that the project has been completed per the spec-driven design, develop documentation using MkDocs that will be hosted in Github Pages. This will require a new subdirectory in the repo that can be configured in Github to serve via Github Pages.

GitHub Copilot: I'll create comprehensive documentation for the todo application using MkDocs that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. First, let me examine the existing MkDocs structure to understand the best practices, then create a new documentation subdirectory. Now let me check the existing todo-app documentation structure to understand what's already documented: Now let me create a comprehensive MkDocs documentation structure for the todo application. I'll create a new `docs` subdirectory in the root of the project that can be configured for GitHub Pages:
