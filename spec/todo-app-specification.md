# Design Document

## Overview

The Todo application will be built using React with TypeScript, leveraging Headless UI components for accessible interactions. The architecture follows component-based design principles with clear separation of concerns between data management, UI components, and business logic. The application will use Tailwind CSS for styling and implement PWA features through service workers and a web app manifest.

### Design Goals
- Maximize accessibility through Headless UI components
- Ensure clean, maintainable code architecture
- Provide excellent user experience across all device types
- Implement comprehensive PWA capabilities

### Key Design Decisions
- **Headless UI Components**: Use Dialog, Button, Checkbox, Listbox for core interactions
- **State Management**: React useState and useContext for simplicity
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage with JSON serialization
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom component classes

## Architecture

### System Context
The application is a client-side React SPA with no external dependencies or API calls. All data is managed locally within the browser environment.

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Framework | React 18+ with TypeScript | Type safety and modern React features |
| UI Components | Headless UI | Accessible, unstyled components |

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Data Types

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  completed: boolean;
  category: TaskCategory;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

type TaskCategory = 'work' | 'personal' | 'shopping' | 'health' | 'other';

type FilterType = 'all' | 'active' | 'completed' | TaskCategory;

interface AppState {
  tasks: Task[];
  filter: FilterType;
  isAddingTask: boolean;
  editingTaskId: string | null;
}
```

### Component Architecture

#### App Component
**Purpose**: Root component managing global state and routing

**Responsibilities**:
- Initialize application state
- Provide context to child components
- Handle PWA registration
- Manage global keyboard shortcuts

#### TaskList Component
**Purpose**: Display and manage the list of tasks

**Responsibilities**:
- Render filtered list of tasks
- Handle task interactions (complete, edit, delete)
- Manage empty states
- Provide keyboard navigation

**Headless UI Components Used**:
- `Checkbox` for task completion
- `Button` for action buttons
- `Dialog` for delete confirmation

#### TaskForm Component
**Purpose**: Handle task creation and editing

**Responsibilities**:
- Collect task data from user input
- Validate input data
- Submit new or edited tasks
- Handle form state management

**Headless UI Components Used**:
- `Dialog` for modal form
- `Listbox` for category selection
- `Button` for form actions

#### FilterBar Component
**Purpose**: Provide filtering and search capabilities

**Responsibilities**:
- Display filter options
- Handle filter selection
- Show active filter state
- Provide search functionality

**Headless UI Components Used**:
- `RadioGroup` for filter selection
- `Button` for quick filters

#### TaskItem Component
**Purpose**: Individual task display and interactions

**Responsibilities**:
- Display task information
- Handle inline editing
- Provide completion toggle
- Show task actions menu

**Headless UI Components Used**:
- `Checkbox` for completion status
- `Menu` for task actions
- `Button` for quick actions

### Custom Hooks

#### useTasks Hook
```typescript
interface UseTasksReturn {
  tasks: Task[];
  addTask: (task: Omit<Task, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>) => void;
  updateTask: (id: string, updates: Partial<Task>) => void;
  deleteTask: (id: string) => void;
  toggleTask: (id: string) => void;
  clearCompleted: () => void;
}
```

#### useLocalStorage Hook
```typescript
interface UseLocalStorageReturn<T> {
  value: T;
  setValue: (value: T | ((prev: T) => T)) => void;
  clearValue: () => void;
}
```

#### useKeyboardShortcuts Hook
```typescript
interface UseKeyboardShortcutsProps {
  onNewTask: () => void;
  onToggleFilter: () => void;
  onClearCompleted: () => void;
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **Task Creation**: User opens task form → Form validates input → New task added to state → State persisted to localStorage
2. **Task Completion**: User clicks checkbox → Task status toggled → State updated → Changes persisted
3. **Task Filtering**: User selects filter → Filter state updated → Task list re-renders with filtered items
4. **Data Persistence**: Any state change → Automatic save to localStorage → Data available on app reload

## Accessibility Implementation

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab order follows logical flow: filters → add button → task list → individual tasks
- Enter key activates buttons and confirms actions
- Escape key closes dialogs and cancels editing
- Arrow keys navigate within complex components (listbox, menu)

### Screen Reader Support
- All interactive elements have proper labels
- Task status changes are announced
- Form validation errors are clearly announced
- Loading states and empty states are properly described

### Focus Management
- Focus is trapped within open dialogs
- Focus returns to triggering element when dialogs close
- Visual focus indicators are always visible
- Focus is managed during dynamic content updates

# Tasks Document

## Implementation Overview

The todo application will be implemented in phases, starting with core functionality and progressively adding features. The implementation emphasizes accessibility, clean code architecture, and thorough testing. Each component will be developed with TypeScript for type safety and tested with React Testing Library.

### Implementation Strategy
- Component-driven development using Headless UI building blocks
- Test-driven development for business logic
- Progressive enhancement for PWA features
- Mobile-first responsive design approach

### Development Approach
- **Testing Strategy**: Multi-layered testing approach with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Integration Strategy**: Bottom-up development starting with utilities and hooks
- **Deployment Strategy**: Static build deployment with PWA manifest

## Testing Framework and Quality Assurance

### Testing Philosophy
Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, tests are written before or alongside implementation to ensure:
- Requirements are properly understood and implemented
- Code quality is maintained throughout development
- Regressions are caught early in the development cycle
- Accessibility standards are continuously validated

### Testing Layers

#### 1. Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Coverage Target**: >90% code coverage
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Jest-axe for accessibility
- **Scope**: Components, hooks, utilities, business logic

#### 2. Integration Tests
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **Tools**: React Testing Library with MockServiceWorker for API mocking
- **Scope**: Component combinations, context providers, hook interactions

#### 3. End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows and PWA functionality
- **Tools**: Playwright with axe-playwright for accessibility
- **Scope**: Critical user journeys, cross-browser compatibility, PWA features

#### 4. Accessibility Tests
- **Purpose**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout development
- **Tools**: jest-axe, axe-playwright, manual testing with screen readers
- **Scope**: All interactive elements, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility

### Testing Standards and Conventions

#### Test Structure
All tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:
```typescript
describe('Component/Feature', () => {
  it('should behave as expected when condition occurs', () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test data and environment
    // Act: Perform the action being tested
    // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
  });
});
```

#### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `feature.test.ts`
- E2E tests: `feature-name.e2e.ts`
- Test descriptions: Use "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"

#### Quality Gates
Each task must pass these quality gates before being considered complete:

- [ ] Integration tests validate component interactions
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass (automated and manual)
