# Overview

The **Headless UI Todo App** is a comprehensive task management application that demonstrates best practices for building accessible, performant, and maintainable React applications.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

- **Accessibility Excellence**: Demonstrate how to build fully accessible applications using Headless UI components
- **Modern React Patterns**: Showcase current best practices in React development with TypeScript
- **Spec-Driven Development**: Provide a real-world example of specification-driven development methodology
- **Production Readiness**: Include all aspects needed for a production application

### Target Audience

- **React Developers** learning about accessibility and Headless UI
- **Teams** looking for accessible component patterns
- **Organizations** implementing spec-driven development
- **Students** studying modern web development practices

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

### Component-Driven Design

The application follows a strict component-driven architecture where each piece of functionality is encapsulated in reusable, testable components.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App] --> B[TaskList]
    A --> C[TaskForm]
    A --> D[FilterBar]
    B --> E[TaskItem]
    C --> F[CategorySelect]
    D --> G[FilterButton]
    
    H[useTasks] --> A
    I[useLocalStorage] --> H
    J[useKeyboardShortcuts] --> A
```

### Accessibility-First Approach

Every component is built with accessibility as a primary concern:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **ARIA Labels**: Comprehensive labeling for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus flow and visual indicators

### Progressive Enhancement

The application works without JavaScript and progressively enhances the experience:

1. **Base Layer**: Core HTML and CSS
2. **Enhancement Layer**: JavaScript interactions
3. **Advanced Layer**: PWA features and offline support

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Simplicity

Clean, uncluttered interface that focuses on task management without distractions.

### Consistency

Consistent interaction patterns and visual design throughout the application.

### Performance

Optimized for speed with lazy loading, efficient rendering, and minimal bundle size.

### Flexibility

Extensible architecture that allows for easy addition of new features.
